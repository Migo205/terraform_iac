AWS 3-Tier High Availability Infrastructure with Terraform
A complete infrastructure as code project using Terraform to deploy a highly available 3-tier architecture on AWS. This project provides a secure, scalable, and production-ready environment for web applications.

Architecture Overview
Core Components
Web Tier: Application Load Balancer (ALB) with Auto Scaling Groups of EC2 instances

Application Tier: Internal Application Load Balancer (IALB) with EC2 instances in private subnets

Data Tier: Multi-AZ RDS database with read replicas and automated backups

Networking: Secure VPC architecture with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones

Features
High Availability: Multi-AZ deployment across 3 availability zones

Auto Scaling: Automatic scaling of web and application tiers based on demand

Security: Network segmentation, security groups, and IAM roles with least privilege

Disaster Recovery: Automated backups and multi-AZ failover for database tier

Infrastructure as Code: Complete environment defined in Terraform for reproducibility

Monitoring: CloudWatch alarms and logging configured for all components

Prerequisites
Required Tools
Terraform 1.0+

AWS CLI 2.0+

Git

AWS Requirements
AWS Account with appropriate permissions

IAM user with programmatic access

Key Pair for EC2 instances

Quick Start
1. Clone Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/Migo205/aws-3tier-ha-terraform-.git
cd aws-3tier-ha-terraform-
2. Configure AWS Credentials
bash
aws configure
# Or set environment variables:
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"
3. Initialize Terraform
bash
terraform init
4. Review Execution Plan
bash
terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
5. Deploy Infrastructure
bash
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"

Configuration
Required Variables
Create a terraform.tfvars file with the following variables:

hcl
# AWS Configuration
aws_region = "us-east-1"
project_name = "my-3tier-app"
environment = "production"

# Network Configuration
vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
availability_zones = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]

# Instance Configuration
web_instance_type = "t3.medium"
app_instance_type = "t3.medium"
web_instance_count = 2
app_instance_count = 2

# Database Configuration
db_instance_class = "db.t3.medium"
db_name = "application_db"
db_username = "admin"
# db_password should be provided securely
Optional Variables
enable_cloudwatch_alarms: Enable CloudWatch alarms (default: true)

enable_auto_scaling: Enable Auto Scaling policies (default: true)

backup_retention_period: RDS backup retention in days (default: 7)

monitoring_email: Email for CloudWatch notifications

Infrastructure Details
Networking
VPC with CIDR block configuration

Public and private subnets in each availability zone

Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway

Route tables with appropriate routing

VPC endpoints for AWS services

Security
Security groups for each tier with minimum required access

IAM roles with instance profiles

Database security with encryption at rest and in transit

Network ACLs for additional layer of security

Compute
Launch templates for consistent instance configuration

Auto Scaling groups with health checks

Application Load Balancer (public facing)

Internal Load Balancer (application tier)

Database
Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL) with Multi-AZ deployment

Automated backups with point-in-time recovery

Read replicas for read scalability

Parameter groups for database optimization

Outputs
After deployment, Terraform will output:

web_alb_dns_name: DNS name for the web load balancer

vpc_id: VPC ID

database_endpoint: RDS endpoint

bastion_host_public_ip: Bastion host public IP (if enabled)

cloudwatch_dashboard_url: CloudWatch dashboard URL

Operations
Scaling
bash
# Update Auto Scaling group desired capacity
terraform apply -var="web_instance_count=4" -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
Updates
bash
# Update infrastructure with new configuration
terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
Destruction
bash
# Destroy all resources (use with caution)
terraform destroy -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
Monitoring and Maintenance
CloudWatch Metrics
CPU utilization for all instances

Database connection count and latency

Load balancer request count and latency

Auto Scaling group metrics

Logging
VPC Flow Logs for network traffic

CloudTrail for API calls

RDS performance insights

Application logs via CloudWatch Logs

Security Considerations
Secrets Management: Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store for database credentials

Key Rotation: Implement regular key rotation for EC2 key pairs

IAM Least Privilege: Regularly review IAM policies and permissions

Security Updates: Enable automatic security updates for EC2 instances

Network Monitoring: Monitor VPC Flow Logs for suspicious activity

Cost Optimization
Use Spot Instances for non-critical workloads

Implement Auto Scaling to scale down during off-peak hours

Use reserved instances for baseline capacity

Clean up unused resources regularly

Monitor cost using AWS Cost Explorer

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Terraform State Errors

Use terraform init -reconfigure to reinitialize

Check state file permissions

AWS Rate Limiting

Implement exponential backoff in automation scripts

Contact AWS support for limit increases

Connection Issues

Verify security group rules

Check route tables and NACLs

Validate VPC endpoints

Log Locations
Terraform logs: Check terraform.tfstate and terraform.tfstate.backup

AWS CLI logs: aws logs describe-log-groups

Instance logs: Connect via Session Manager or SSH
